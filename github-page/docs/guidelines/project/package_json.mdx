## The `files` field

The `files` field is used to specify which files and folders to be included in the publish package.

You **should** always specify the `files` field.

> Why?

By default, files not excluded by `.gitignore` (or `.npmignore`) are included, which is not what you want.
Also, files that are excluded by `.gitignore` are not included, which is likely also not what you want.

So it is always better to be explicit and control them yourself.

For example, if the `files` field is removed from [type-plus],

files like `.changeset/*`, `.github/*`, `.vscode/*` are included,
while `cjs/*` and `esm/*` are not.

You **should** use `files` field to exclude test files.

For example, add this to your `files` field:

```json5
{
  "files": [
    // your package files
    "cjs",
    "esm",
    "testing",
    "ts",
    // exclude test files
    "!**/*.{spec,test,unit,accept,integrate,system}.*"
  ]
}
```

> Why?

Doing this allows you to keep your tsconfig setup simple.
You will always compile all files, including your test files.

This ensures that your test files does not contain any syntax error.
