# Migrating TypeScript code for `type: module`

TypeScript 4.7 is released üéâ!

Finally the wait is over.
You are excited to start your migration.

So you update your `package.json`,
update your `tsconfig.json`,
and volia, you are greeted with a boat load of errors.

What you need to do is to update your `import` statements:

- add `.js` extension for files, or
- add `/index.js` for folders.

You can do that manually,
or you can use a tool to help you on that.

The tool ([`tsc-esm-fix`]) is the focus of the topic today.
But before that,
let me highlight a few things about the current state of the `type: module` support in TypeScript 4.7,
so that you can decide should you take the jump right now,
or should you wait a little bit longer.

There are four issues that I'm aware of related to `type: module`.

## The `.js` extension debate

The first one is a debate around the `.js` extension.

The take aways are:

- `.js` is artifical, pointing to a non-existing file
- TypeScript team do not want to rewrite JS code
- NodeJS needs extra tricks to detect the source type

You can read about the detail here:

- <https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/49083>
- <https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/16577#issuecomment-754941937>

## broken source map

The second one is that source map is currently broken.

If your code will be used in the browser,
you need to weight that in.

You can read about the detail here: <https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/49335>

## ts-loader workaround

The third one is that currently [`ts-loader`] does not support ESM module out of the box.

You have to do two things.

1. use the `NormalModuleReplacmentPlugin`:

```js
{
  plugins: [
    new NormalModuleReplacementPlugin(/.js$/, (resource) => {
      if (/node_modules/.test(resource.context)) return
      resource.request = resource.request.replace(/.js$/, '')
    })
  ]
}
```

2. Do not use `transpileOnly: true`. It does not work.

If I have time, I might dig in to help [`ts-loader`] about this,
but not sure when I'll be able to do that.

You can read about the detail heere: <https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/issues/1463>

## jest ESM workaround

The last one is an outstanding one,
that [`jest`] does not have native support of ESM.

Meaning when you use [`ts-jest`], you also need to use [`babel-jest`] to transpile dependencies within `node_modules`.

Here is a nutshell of what you need to do:

```js
// jest.config.mjs
export default {
  preset: 'ts-jest/presets/default-esm',
  globals: {
    'ts-jest': {
      useESM: true
    }
  },
  moduleNameMapper: {
    // remove the phantom `.js` extension
    '^(\\.{1,2}/.*)\\.js$': '$1',
    // If dependency doing `import ... from '#<pkg>'.
    // e.g. `chalk` has this: `import ... form '#ansi-styles'`
    '#(.*)': '<rootDir>/node_modules/$1'
  },
  transformIgnorePatterns: [
    // Need to MANUALLY identify each ESM package, one by one
    'node_modules/(?!(@unional\\fixture|chalk)/)'
  ],
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.(js|jsx|mjs)$': 'babel-jest',
  }
}
```

## `tsc-esm-fix`

Now, if you decide to move ahead,
then you can use [`tsc-esm-fix`] to help you.

I used it to help me migrating [`type-plus`], which has 140+ files.
I'm using it for other packages as I'm writing this blog.

I have discovered a few bugs and @antongolub is very quick to fix them.
Go to the repo and give it a star ‚≠ê!

The easiest way to use it is through `npx` or `yarn dlx`:

```sh
npx tsc-esm-fix --src=<src> --ext='.js'

// or
yarn dlx tsc-esm-fix --src=<src> --ext='.js'
```

For [`type-plus`], since I put the source code under the `ts` folder,
so the command is:

```sh
npx tsc-esm-fix --src=ts --ext='.js'
```

If you put your source code under the typical `src` folder,
then the command is:

```sh
npx tsc-esm-fix --src=src --ext='.js'
```

Happy Coding, üßë‚Äçüíª
