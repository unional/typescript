Welcome to TypeScript Blackbook.

The goal of this book is to help you get the most out of TypeScript.

To achieve that goal,
this book covers more than just style guide and best practices.

You need to know *why* should you write code in certain way,
*what* are the *trade-offs* you are making,
as well as the design and the limitations of the language itself,
so that you have the right *mindset* and *approach* to your problem and come to a solution effectively.

It needs to cover everything related to TypeScript in order to achieve that goal.
But learning everything about TypeScript is not easy.

The language itself is pretty complex,
and both TypeScript and JavaScript evolves at a rapid pace.


So it can be quite overwhelming if you are just starting out.



<!-- This book is organized into a few sections:

- How to TypeScript: Designs, limitations, and approach
- TypeScript (and JavaScript) syntax and features
- Coding Styles and Guidelines
- Supporting Tools -->

<!--
I would recommend having a quick read through of the [How to TypeScript] section,
and then check out the [Supporting Tools] section to find out how to set up your project,
and use the rest of the book for reference as you need them. -->



Having that said,
I'm in the process of updating this book.

Most of the information are still in their old format.
So please head over to the [GitHub repo] to look for the original content for the time being.
