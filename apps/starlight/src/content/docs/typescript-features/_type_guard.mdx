title: "Type guard"

[User-defined type guard functions][type_guard] is a function which its return type is specified as `x as T`.

It is introduced in TypeScript 1.6.

For example:

```ts
function isBool(x: unknown): x is boolean {
  return typeof x === 'boolean';
}

let value = 'true' as unknown

if (isBool(value)) {
  // `value` is narrowed to boolean
}
```

You **do not** need to write type guard functions for simple cases.

> Why?

TypeScript control flow analysis recognize many basic patterns and perform narrowing automatically.

For example:

```ts
let value:  number |  string = 123

if (typeof value === 'number') {
	// `value` is narrowed to number
}
```

You **can** use `isType` from [type-plus] for one-off assertion functions (especially if you are already using it).

> Why?

In many cases, you only need to do type guard for a few specific cases.

If you are already using [type-plus],
you can use the `isType()` generic type guard so that you don't have to break your flow and add an addition function.

```ts
const { data } = useQuery(...)

if (isType<YourData>(data, v => ...predicate...)) {
	// `data` is narrowed to `YourData`
}
```
