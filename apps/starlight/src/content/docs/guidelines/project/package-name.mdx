When you create a package,
you always have to go through the painful process of naming your package.

While it is not specific to TypeScript,
it is still beneficial to follow certain guidelines to make your life a bit easier.

---

You **should** use `snake_case` for your package name.

> Why?

[NodeJS] is not opinionated about package names, but
[Deno] prohibits using `kebab-case` or `PascalCase` as module name.

Since [Deno] is likely to stay, you should use `snake_case` so that they are consistent.

---

You **should** name your package with nouns.

> Why?

Naming your package with verbs typically means your package is doing just one thing.

Of course, if that is what you want, that's fine.

But naming your package with nouns allows you to add similar features to your package, without causing confusion.
