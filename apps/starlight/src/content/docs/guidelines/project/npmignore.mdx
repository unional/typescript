The `.npmignore` file is used to keep stuff out of your package.

You **should not** use `.npmignore` file

> Why?

There are [problematic situations](https://medium.com/@jdxcode/for-the-love-of-god-dont-use-npmignore-f93c08909d8d) when using `.npmignore` file.

You can actually exclude files and folders using the [files field](./package-json#the-files-field).
There is no reason to use `.npmignore` file.
