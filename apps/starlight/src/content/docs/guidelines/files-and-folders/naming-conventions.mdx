# Naming Convention

You **should** name your file and folder in `snake_case` or `kebab-case` instead of `camelCase` or `PascalCase`.

> Why?

Some file systems are case-insensitive (yes, I'm looking at you, Windows).
That means `ApiSpec == apispec == APISpec`.

To avoid confusion, `camelCase` and `PascalCase` should be avoided.
That leave us with `snake_case` or `kebab-case`.

The benefits of `snake_case` over `kebab-case` is that,
in most cases, operating system treats `snake_case` as a single word,
and treats `kebab-case` as a composed word.

For example, when you double-click on a `kebab-case` string,
a single word will be selected (i.e. either `kebab` or `case` will be selected).

On the other hand, double-click on a `snake_case` string will select the whole string.

The same goes to renaming.

Therefore, I would recommend `snake_case` over `kebab-case`,
even though `_` takes an additional pinky press to type.

But `kebab-case` is still a valid choice,
especially when you are using file-based routing.

You **should** name your file in nouns. i.e. `customer_order.ts` instead of `create_customer_order.ts`.

> Why?

You might have heard of Single Responsibility Principle and think that you should have one function per file.

That is utterly wrong and not what SRP means.

SRP is about putting related code together where they have the same reason to change.

Naming (and thus organizing) the file with nouns will significantly make your file and folder a lot more stable.

Meaning there will be less import path changes.

You **can** use `.` to create sub-category on filenames.

> Why

The name of the file should describe WHAT the file is about,
in terms of its context or business value.

For example, `customer_order.ts`.

However, there are situations that you want to further organize the code into addition categories,
so that it is easy to visualize as well as controlling the exposed API.

For example, you can do this:

```sh
customer_order.ts
customer_order.ctx.ts # context code for dependency injection
customer_order.internal.ts # code that you use internally, but exported for your tests.
customer_order.mock.ts # helper code for mocking the data during tests
customer_order.spec.ts # specification tests
customer_order.unit.ts # unit tests
customer_order.unit.electron.ts # unit tests only for electron
```
