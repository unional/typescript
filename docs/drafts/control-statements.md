# Control Statements

A control statement is a statement that determines whether other statements will be executed.

`if`, `for`, `do`, `while`, `switch`

## `if` statement

## `for` statement

## `for...in` statement

- You can use `for...in` without the need to check `.hasOwnProperty()`

  > Why? If your code is typed, you don't really need it.
  > If your code is not typed, you should type it.
  > If you want to keep the code not typed, you probably should know what you are doing.
