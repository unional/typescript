# Assignment Operators

> An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.

You **may** do chain assignment.

```ts
// ok
const a = b = 1
```

> Why?

In JavaScript,
chain assignment is not a good idea because you might introduce global variable if you are not careful.

However, in TypeScript you don't have this problem because the compilier will spot the error for you ðŸ˜Ž.

---

You **should not** have linebreaks before or after `=` in an assignment.

```ts
// bad
const foo =
  'foo'

// bad
const foo
  = 'foo'

// good
const foo = 'foo'
```

> Why?

These incidental linebreaks would throw off tools that rely on comments.

```ts
// bad, broke tooling
// istanbul ignore next
// tslint:disable-next-line
const foo =
  somethingToIgnore()

// good
// istanbul ignore next
// tslint:disable-next-line
const foo = somethingToIgnore()
```
