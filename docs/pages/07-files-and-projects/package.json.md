# package.json

## files

If you do not use the `inlineSources` compiler options,
add your source folder into the `files` array.

> Why?

The source map generated by `tsc` has `"sources":["../src/<file>.ts"]`.
If the source code is not distributed,
tools such as `webpack` will emit a warning saying it cannot resolve the source file.
